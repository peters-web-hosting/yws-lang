# Contribute to Translations

Welcome to the **YWS-lang** repository! We appreciate your interest in helping us make our project accessible to a broader audience by contributing translations.

## About `en.json`

The `en.json` file contains the English language strings used in our project. We aim to translate these strings into multiple languages, and we need your help!

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your own copy of this repository.

2. **Create a New Branch**: In your forked repository, create a new branch for your translation. You can name it according to the language you are translating to, such as `fr-translation` for French.

3. **Translate the Strings**: Open the `en.json` file and translate the strings into your target language. Please ensure that the format remains consistent.

4. **Add Your Language File**: Create a new file named `YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE.json` (for example, `fr.json` for French) and add your translated strings there.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you have completed the translation, commit your changes with a clear message indicating the translation.

6. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and submit a pull request from your branch. Weâ€™ll review it and merge it if everything looks good!

### Guidelines for Translation

- Keep the context in mind when translating.
- If you encounter any terms or phrases that are unclear, feel free to ask for clarification in the issues section.
